Include a screenshot of your cracked passwords. Sufficiently anonymize it so that no user can be identified. 

You must crack something that has an actual unaware user that you can notify. Using anonymized hash lists intended for testing hashcracking is unlikely to count. 

Name your file as "Name - flag.png". jpg is also an ok file format. Maybe don't submit a PDF, because I don't have all day to explode it in a VM to make sure you're not pranking me :-)

There may be some overlap with Have I Been Pwned or other most common password lists, e.g. "password" or "abc123". Those are anecdotally in use in real admin accounts, but do not count for winning solid silver tiles. You can use other cracking lists like HIBP for that. 

By adding your solution, you're affirming that you'll do your best to inform the user that they need to change their password!
