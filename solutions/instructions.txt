Include a screenshot of your cracked passwords. Sufficiently anonymize it so that no user can be identified. 

Name your file as "Name - flag.png". jpg is also an ok file format. Maybe don't submit a PDF, because I don't have all day to explode it in a VM to make sure you're not pranking me :-)

By adding your solution, you're affirming that you'll do your best to inform the user that they need to change their password!
